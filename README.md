## üöÄ Quick Start

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start both frontend and backend in development mode
npm run dev

# Or start individually:
npm run dev:client  # Frontend only (Vite dev server)
npm run dev:server  # Backend only (Express server)
```

### Production
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## üê≥ Docker Container

This application is containerized and automatically published to GitHub Container Registry.

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run with ephemeral storage
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/jasonetco/drinks:latest
```

### With Persistent Database (Recommended)
```bash
# Mount the recipes.db file directly
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -v $(pwd)/recipes.db:/app/recipes.db \
  ghcr.io/jasonetco/drinks:latest
```

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_PATH`: Path to SQLite database file (default: `./recipes.db`)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: `3000`)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (`development` or `production`)

### Database Backup and Restore
```bash
# The database file contains both recipes and inventory data
# To backup, simply copy the local recipes.db file
cp recipes.db backup-recipes.db

# To restore, copy your backup back
cp backup-recipes.db recipes.db
```

The SQLite database includes:
- **Recipes table**: All cocktail recipes with ingredients and instructions
- **Inventory table**: Bar inventory items with quantities, categories, and barcodes

## üì± Mobile Sleep Prevention

The application includes a mobile sleep prevention feature that uses the Screen Wake Lock API to keep your device's screen active while viewing recipes.

### Usage

- **Availability**: The toggle appears automatically on mobile devices that support the Wake Lock API
- **Location**: Found in the top-right corner of the homepage header on mobile
- **Default State**: Off (allows normal screen sleep behavior)
- **Toggle States**: 
  - "Sleep" (default) - Screen can go to sleep normally
  - "Awake" - Screen stays active and won't go to sleep

### Browser Compatibility

The feature works on modern mobile browsers that support the Screen Wake Lock API, including:
- Chrome for Android (84+)
- Edge Mobile (84+)
- Safari iOS (16.4+)

For unsupported browsers, the toggle will not appear and the app functions normally.

### Technical Details

- Uses the native `navigator.wakeLock` API
- Automatically releases wake lock when switching tabs or minimizing the app
- Re-acquires wake lock when returning to the app (if previously enabled)
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
