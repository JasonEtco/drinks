🐳 Docker Container

This repository includes a Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflow for containerization:

- **Docker Hub**: The app is automatically built and published as a Docker container
- **Registry**: Available on GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`)
- **Usage**: `docker run -p 80:80 ghcr.io/jasonetco/mixmaster-cocktail-r:latest`

The container serves the Mixmaster Cocktail application using nginx and is automatically built on pushes to the `main` branch.
